## How to use
You can use [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) then copy paste the css to apply theme. 

I'm currently using [Roam Toolkit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roam-toolkit/ebckolanhdjilblnkcgcgifaikppnhba) extension. Copy the CSS, choose Custom CSS on extension menu then paste and save.
